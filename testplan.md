# Test plan

## 1.	Introduction
### 1.1	Purpose
The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given iteration.
It describes the approach to testing the software.
This Test Plan for vnv supports the following objectives:
-	Identifies the items that should be targeted by the tests.
-	Identifies the motivation for and ideas behind the test areas to be covered.
-	Outlines the testing approach that will be used.
-	Identifies the required resources and provides an estimate of the test efforts.

### 1.2	Scope
This document describes the used tests.

### 1.3	Intended Audience
This document is meant for internal use primarily.

### 1.4	Document Terminology and Acronyms
- **SRS**	Software Requirements Specification
- **n/a**	not applicable
- **tbd**	to be determined

## 2.	Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation
### 2.1	Background
By testing our project, we make sure that all changes to the sourcecode do not break the functionality. Also by integrating the test process in our deployment process, we make sure that only working versions of our project getting deployed.
### 2.2	Evaluation Mission
n/a
### 2.3	Test Motivators
Our testing is motivated by
- quality risks
- technical risks
- use cases
- functional requirements

### 10.1	People and Roles
This table shows the staffing assumptions for the test effort.
|---|---|---|
|Role|Minimum Resources Recommended(number of full-time roles allocated)|Specific Responsibilities or Comments|








| Role | Minimum Resources Recommended(number of full-time roles allocated) | Specific Responsibilities or Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Test Manager|1| Provides management oversight.  Responsibilities include:  planning and logistics  agree mission  identify motivators acquire appropriate resources present management reporting advocate the interests of test evaluate effectiveness of test effort|
|Test Designer|1|Defines the technical approach to the implementation of the test effort.  Responsibilities include: define test approach define test automation architecture verify test techniques define testability elements structure test implementation|
|Tester|1|Implements and executes the tests. Responsibilities include: implement tests and test suites execute test suites log results analyze and recover from test failures document incidents|
|Test System Administrator|1|Ensures test environment and assets are managed and maintained. Responsibilities include: 	administer test management system install and support access to, and recovery of, test environment configurations and test labs|

## 11.	Iteration Milestones

| Milestone | Planned Start Date | Actual Start Date | Planned End Date | Actual End Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Have Unit Tests |  |    |    |    |
| 20% coverage |  |    |    |    |

## 12.	Risks, Dependencies, Assumptions, and Constraints
| Risk | Mitigation Strategy	| Contingency (Risk is realized) |
|---|---|---|
| Untestable features in <br/>the framework | Cannot be avoided | Try to test it with integration tests |
| Testing scenario is not <br/>covered | Carefully design tests | Add scenario | 
| Technical Difficulties for Testers | Try to help remote | Try it out on different browsers before and check the availability on multiple systems |
